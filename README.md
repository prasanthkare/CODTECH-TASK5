# <ins>Project Name</ins> :- RECIPE FINDER APPLICATION

The **Food Recipe Finder** web page is a simple, user-friendly tool that allows users to search for recipes based on specific food items or ingredients. The HTML structure includes an input field where users can type in their desired ingredient or recipe name, and a search button that initiates the recipe search process.

### Key Components:
1. **Search Input Field**: The input field lets users type keywords related to recipes or ingredients they are interested in. It provides a convenient way to search by entering a specific term.
  
2. **Search Button with Icon**: The search button, designed with a magnifying glass icon, allows users to submit their query. The icon is built with an SVG graphic for sharp, scalable visuals.

3. **Recipe Results Section**: Once a search is performed, matching recipes are displayed in the "recipe-result" section. The results are dynamically populated within an unordered list (`<ul>`) with an ID of "results."

4. **External CSS and JavaScript Files**:
   - `style.css` styles the page, adding design elements like layout, colors, and fonts.
   - `script.js` contains the JavaScript code to handle search input processing and display recipe results based on user queries.

The Recipe Finder combines a clean, minimalist design with functionality that makes it easy for users to find recipes quickly, using only the ingredients they have on hand or specific recipe names they are curious about.
